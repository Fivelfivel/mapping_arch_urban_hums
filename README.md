## Description

We are in the midst of a technological revolution, resulting in seemingly endless amounts of data and the computing technologies to analyze and contextualize that data. In response, our relationship to the spaces we inhabit and those that we don't has shifted. We are challenged to make sense of spaces we have never visited, analyze data we did not collect and bring together people and ideas that have never met. As these forces propel us towards increased global awareness, we must remain critical of the tools and technologies that we use to represent, visualize, and analyze the world. 

This course addresses these forces through an introduction to critical mapping theory and the use of geographic information systems. We will use open source GIS Software (QGIS), and publicly available datasets to critically apply geographic thinking to humanistic problems. Through this course, students will develop the technological and analytical skills necessary to engage in spatial analysis and representation.

Using a hybrid flipped-classroom approach, students will work through technical tutorials, complete hands-on mapping exercises, and situate this work within theories of mapping and cartography.

## Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Employ best practices for visual communication of spatial information
* Critically read a map
* Critically apply mapping theory to spatial projects
* Make intentional design decisions when composing maps for publication
* Decide when to use a static map and when to use a webmap

* Use QGIS to analyze geographic information
* Strategically use maps and layers to tell a story
* Find and clean datasets for use in GIS
* Turn a static map into a webmap

## Grading

30% Individual assignments and tutorials <br>
15% Midterm<br>
15% Map critique<br>
30% Final project<br>
10% White paper

## Course Design
This course is a project-based, hybrid seminar/laboratory. Each meeting will be divided into two sections. In the first half, we will discuss one element of critical cartography based on the readings. In the second half, we will discuss the tutorial and its implications. To get the most out of the sessions, you will need to do the readings and the tutorial in advance.

## Assignments 
There are weekly assignments that result from the tutorials. These are graded by submission only. You may work alone, in pairs or groups of three. Please submit them via email by Friday at 10am. If you need an extension, you must ask for it by Thursday. Extensions will not be granted on Friday. 
* November 3: Midterm
* November 17: Map Critique

## Midterm & Final
The Midterm leads to the final. By the midterm, you should have a question or thesis that you want to explore, analyze, or explain using some type of map, broadly defined. This will form the basis of your final project. Projects can be web, digital, or analogue, but must take the viewer through your hypothesis, argument, or story. The final project will be the execution of your research and design. The white paper will discuss the methods you used and decisions you made. Detailed descriptions will be distributed at least three weeks in advance.
